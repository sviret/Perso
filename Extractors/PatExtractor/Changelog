       * Some changes for the m_tt analysis:
        * selection complete for semimu and semie (apart from vertex cut for leptons and eleID, still missing!)
        * various b-tagging algorithms outputs retrieved
        * chi2 working for both semimu and semie channel
        * kinematic fit working for both semimu and semie channel
2011-05-31 Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
       * Added a /batch/ directory containing a script to produce PATuples from ReReco AODs

2011-05-31 Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
       * AnalysisSettings class has been added in order to easily add user-defined cuts into the analysis.
       * To see it in action, a small example class (dimuon_analysis.cc) has been added. 
       * This dimuon analysis is launched using the python script DiMuExample.py 
       * Those modifications have been tested and have no effect on other classes

       * VertexExtractor has been upgraded, new params were added to the base tree. 

2011-05-25 Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
       * TrackExtractor class added (to get generalTracks info, this is sometime useful)
       * PAT_extractor_cfi.py was modified: all do_*** parameters were set to false. You
	have to add what you want in your own python script, this will avoid file content problems
       * A new parameter was added to the cfi file: 'fillTree' : this tells if you start from a 
	PATuple (True) or an extracted ROOTuple (False). If set to false you then just rerun the analysis
	, this is much faster if you just want to redo this step, and avoid double coding...
       * In the test directory a small example script was added: Extractor_redo.py, it takes an extracted 
	rootfile as input, and put the analysis results in another rootfile. 
  
       * And yes, we write the dates mirrored...

2011-05-18 viola <sordini@cern.ch>
       * Fisrt version of mtt_analysis with skeleton for semie selection (not sure yet wether the chi2 does
	meaningful stuff for semie)

2011-05-17 viola <sordini@cern.ch>
	(seriously: we write the dates mirrored??)
	First commit of mtt_analysis (for event selection) and Chi2 (for chi2 calculation)
	with some minor related changes in other classes (Jet,Mu,El,vtx,met extractors, plus
	python file to write on data). 
	For the moment the analysis is there only for seminuonic channel. 
	For this commit i started working on some files modified by Nicolas, so i happen 
	to commit also some changes from him about MC truth and matching (in MCExtractor and mtt_analysis).

2011-05-15 Stephane <saucisson@cern.ch>
       * Bug fix to allow compilation of AlienGS and AlienKinFit

2011-05-11 Nicolas Beaupere <beaupere@ipnl.in2p3.fr>
       * Added MC matching info into Electron,Muon and Photon Extractor class. Matched base on same method than to
       JetExtractor.
       For the moment DeltaR maximum val for a match is set with PAT recomandation.
       
       
2011-05-06 Nicolas Beaupere <beaupere@ipnl.in2p3.fr>
       * Added Chi2, KinFit class (AlienGS.h, AlienKinFit.h) and text file of old resolution values

2011-04-27 Nicolas Beaupere/ Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
       * Added MC matching info into JetExtractor class. Match is done based on container producer by MC extractor
 	using the DeltaR matching method.
	For the moment DeltaR maximum val for a match is set to 0.2
	!!! Double matching protection not yet implemented --> Jets could be matched to the same MC parton (tough unlikely).

2011-04-26 Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
       * PatExtractor goes to class... Completely new architecture, one class per object type
         !!!Changes are fully transparent for the final ROOTuple!!!

2011-04-21 Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
       * Added HLTrigger information to the ntuple (fired paths are stored as a chain of strings)
       * Added a small ROOT macro in the /test/ directory. Just to show how 
	to read the extracted ROOTuple: PAT_extractor_reader.C

2011-04-20 Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
       * Bug fix

2011-04-20 Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
       * Fixed some bugs in TTree initializations
       * Added variables for Jet (PF energy fraction, BTag infos,...)

2011-04-18  Stephane <stephane.perries@cern.ch>
       * Fixed some bugs in the electron variables

2011-04-17  Stephane <stephane.perries@cern.ch>
       * Addition of many variables for the Electrons

2011-04-15  Stephane <stephane.perries@cern.ch>
        * New variables for muons
            * pfIsolation
            * Pixel hits
            * tracker hits

2011-04-15  Stephane <stephane.perries@cern.ch>

        * New variables :
            * a TLorentzVector for each object except the Vertices
            * d0 and d0 error for the muons (note the track has to be embeded in the PatMuons)

2011-04-04  Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
 
       	* New option added to the config file (*_cfi.py), one can now choose
	which trees we want in, and the output file name.


2011-03-31  Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
 
       	* New version including MC information (GenParticles)


2011-03-31  Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
 
       	* Adding a first version of the PatExtractor tool, 
	working with CMSSW 4_1_2_patch1. This is is a first test
