	(seriously: we write the dates mirrored??)
	First commit of mtt_analysis (for event selection) and Chi2 (for chi2 calculation)
	with some minor related changes in other classes (Jet,Mu,El,vtx,met extractors, plus
	python file to write on data). 
	For the moment the analysis is there only for seminuonic channel. 
	For this commit i started working on some files modified by Nicolas, so i happen 
	to commit also some changes from him about MC truth and matching (in MCExtractor and mtt_analysis).

       * Bug fix to allow compilation of AlienGS and AlienKinFit

2011-05-11 Nicolas Beaupere <beaupere@ipnl.in2p3.fr>
       * Added MC matching info into Electron,Muon and Photon Extractor class. Matched base on same method than to
       JetExtractor.
       For the moment DeltaR maximum val for a match is set with PAT recomandation.
       
       
2011-05-06 Nicolas Beaupere <beaupere@ipnl.in2p3.fr>
       * Added Chi2, KinFit class (AlienGS.h, AlienKinFit.h) and text file of old resolution values

2011-04-27 Nicolas Beaupere/ Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
       * Added MC matching info into JetExtractor class. Match is done based on container producer by MC extractor
 	using the DeltaR matching method.
	For the moment DeltaR maximum val for a match is set to 0.2
	!!! Double matching protection not yet implemented --> Jets could be matched to the same MC parton (tough unlikely).

       * PatExtractor goes to class... Completely new architecture, one class per object type
         !!!Changes are fully transparent for the final ROOTuple!!!

2011-04-21 Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
       * Added HLTrigger information to the ntuple (fired paths are stored as a chain of strings)
       * Added a small ROOT macro in the /test/ directory. Just to show how 
	to read the extracted ROOTuple: PAT_extractor_reader.C

2011-04-20 Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
       * Bug fix

2011-04-20 Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
       * Fixed some bugs in TTree initializations
       * Added variables for Jet (PF energy fraction, BTag infos,...)

2011-04-18  Stephane <stephane.perries@cern.ch>
       * Fixed some bugs in the electron variables

2011-04-17  Stephane <stephane.perries@cern.ch>
       * Addition of many variables for the Electrons

2011-04-15  Stephane <stephane.perries@cern.ch>
        * New variables for muons
            * pfIsolation
            * Pixel hits
            * tracker hits

2011-04-15  Stephane <stephane.perries@cern.ch>

        * New variables :
            * a TLorentzVector for each object except the Vertices
            * d0 and d0 error for the muons (note the track has to be embeded in the PatMuons)

2011-04-04  Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
 
       	* New option added to the config file (*_cfi.py), one can now choose
	which trees we want in, and the output file name.


2011-03-31  Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
 
       	* New version including MC information (GenParticles)


2011-03-31  Seb Viret  <viret@in2p3.fr>
 
       	* Adding a first version of the PatExtractor tool, 
	working with CMSSW 4_1_2_patch1. This is is a first test
